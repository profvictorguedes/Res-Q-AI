Just an amazing idea by Tomika Williams (aka Mickey) during a MS hackaton (all props to her).

The idea is to implement a website which talks to the client (first responder) during fire fighters, paramedics, and others, routines, and the agent outputs an easy, down to earth, better response to clarify the action and delivery the message easily, and much faster to the whole team, making rescues much more effective.

General Idea:

An AI-powered app for first responders that automatically converts dispatch notes into a visual scene preview. The app should use Azure AI services to analyze incoming dispatch text, extract key details (location, incident type, hazards, people involved), and generate a simple, interactive map. The map must highlight possible hazards (e.g., fire, chemicals, structural risks), clearly mark entry and exit paths. Ensure the interface is mobile-friendly, loads rapidly.
