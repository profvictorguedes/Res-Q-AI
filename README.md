Innovation Challenge Nov 2025.

An AI-powered app for first responders that automatically converts dispatch notes into a visual scene preview. The app should use Azure AI services to analyze incoming dispatch text, extract key details (location, incident type, hazards, people involved), and generate a simple, interactive map. The map must highlight possible hazards (e.g., fire, chemicals, structural risks), clearly mark entry and exit paths. Ensure the interface is mobile-friendly, loads rapidly.
